    <h1>All about AR/VR - Anish Dubey&reg;</h1>
    <p><b>Welcome to my blog!!</b></p>
    <p>Here, I'm going to provide you information related some <b>AR/VR technologies</b> and will share some good companies links.<br><hr><h2> Augmented Reality (AR)</h2><img src="AR.jfif"alt="AR image"height="300px"width="300px"><br><b>Augmented reality (AR)</b> is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli and delivered via technology. It is a growing trend among companies involved in mobile computing and business applications in particular.</p><hr>
    
    <p ><h2>Virtual reality (VR)</h2>   <img src = "ar image.avif"alt="vr image"height="300px"width="300px" ><br><b>Virtual reality (VR) </b>is a simulated experience that employs pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and business (such as virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR, although definitions are currently changing due to the nascence of the industry.</p><hr>
<p><h2>The Future of Augmented Reality</h2>The market worth of <b>augmented reality</b> is increasing day by day and is estimated to reach <b>$340 billion by 2028</b> and is said to surpass VR in the coming 3-5 years. To know more about the future of augmented reality and what it has to offer to various industries, you can checkout our blog on medium.</p><hr>
<p><h2>The Future of Virtual Reality</h2>The global VR market is expected to grow at a<b> CAGR of 18% and reach $69.60 billion by 2028</b>. Besides its usage in the <b>training</b>, <b>education</b>, and<b> gaming sectors</b>, virtual reality is now widely accepted across industries for various other purposes.</p><hr>
  <p><h2>What is the Difference between AR and VR?</h2>The main difference between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality is that the latter builds an alternate world or reality in which we completely immerse through VR headsets. In other words, VR shut out the real world and gives the user the impression that they are somewhere else. This immersive experience is used mainly in games, training, media, education, etc. Virtual reality environments are achieved with VR headsets such as Oculus Quest, Valve Index, etc<br></p><p>On the other hand, AR projects or overlays computer-generated images, texts, etc. on our world which can be done through smartphones, tablets, or even AR wearables. users can interact with both the real and digital world at the same time. AR is achieved with smartphones, tablets, AR wearables like Microsoft HoloLens, Realwear, etc. In addition to IKEA, companies in the tourism, aviation, healthcare, education, retail, manufacturing, automotive, and more are developing AR solutions.</p><hr>  
    <p><h2>How Augmented Reality can take E-commerce Industry to NewHighs??</h2>Bringing augmented reality into e-commerce bridges the gap between physical and online shopping experiences and gives an immersive real-time interactive experience to customers. Augmented reality has the power to force the audience to purchase products in a way no ordinary websites with 2D images or content can do.</p>
  <p><h3>Augmented Reality is the Future of E-commerce</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Shopping AR.png"alt="AR shop"height="300px"width="300px" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Home AR.jpg"alt="Home decorate Ar"height="300px"width="300px" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <img src="Face AR.jfif"alt="AR use in Face app"height="300px"width="300px" > <br> With no doubt, we can say augmented reality makes online shopping interesting with its engaging and interactive experience. Once you adopt AR to your websites, apps, or your marketing platforms, it is going to forever change how your customers see and buy from your brand.</p>
   <p><h2>How can E-commerce Companies will get Benefit from AR:-</h2><ol>   <h3>1.Improving Customer Relations</h3>When consumers experience a unique customer experience while purchasing from you, they will shop again and even recommend your brand to others. Augmented reality technology helps to boost customer trust and even improve brand loyalty as it removes unnecessary friction and doubts in the shopping journey.</ol><ol><h3>2. Reducing Friction in the Buying Journey</h3>Though all the customer journey processes are now automated, they do face certain hurdles such as knowing in-depth information on complex products. Integrating AR into websites or apps enables the customer to check how the product looks in their space or even how the product fits them and make confident purchase decisions without second thoughts.</ol><ol><h3>3. Reduce Return Rates</h3>Most customers claim that they return goods as the products do not match the description. This leads to disappointment and even permanently not buying from the brand again. But when the customer is given the opportunity to try out or even see the products in their space, their confidence to purchase improves, and the return rates reduce drastically.</ol></p><hr>
  <p><h2>How Virtual Reality and Immersive Technology are Shaping the Future of Learning and Development?</h2><img src="VR2.jpg"alt="Virtual Reality"height="300px"width="300px" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="KD.jpeg"alt="vr" height="300px"width="300px" ><br>Virtual reality can be used to enhance learning experiences and training with AI and machine learning. You can use VR to create interactive learning modules, which are more engaging than traditional classroom lectures. It can improve student motivation and engagement, which will lead to greater retention and comprehension of the material.<br></p>
  <p>Another area where VR significantly impacts is the field of language learning. VR can be used to create environments that provide students with a more authentic and interactive experience. It can be beneficial for learning languages not commonly spoken in oneâ€™s own country, as it allows learners to immerse themselves in a virtual environment where they can practice speaking and listening to the language in a real-world context.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, VR and immersive technology like AI and machine learning are shaping the future of learning and development by providing new and innovative ways for individuals to acquire knowledge and skills. From simulations and interactive learning modules to immersive language learning environments, VR offers educators and learners a wide range of possibilities. We will see more VR-based learning opportunities as VR technology evolves and becomes more mainstream.</p>
